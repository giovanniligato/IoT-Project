The system that we will handle is about a critical room in an industry. Inside this room hazardous situations can occur. For this purpose, several sensors are placed in the room to detect these situations. Furthermore, actuators are deployed to recover the room to a safe state. The aim of the system is to guarantee that when an operator wants to enter the room, the room is in a safe state.




## Storia e Contesto
In the context of an industrial environment, consider a room used for the maintenance and inspection of industrial batteries or fuel cells. These types of rooms, often referred to as battery rooms or fuel cell rooms, are critical due to the potential release of hazardous gases, particularly carbon monoxide (CO), and the heat generated by the batteries or fuel cells during charging and discharging cycles. 

### Real Environment: Industrial Battery Room

**Location:**
- The industrial battery room is located within a larger manufacturing or power generation facility, such as a factory producing electric vehicles, a renewable energy plant using fuel cells, or a data center relying on large battery banks for uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

**Purpose:**
- The primary function of the room is to house large industrial batteries or fuel cells, which are essential for energy storage and backup power. The room is used for regular maintenance, inspection, and occasional repair of these energy storage systems.

**Potential Hazards:**
1. **High Carbon Monoxide Levels:**
   - During the charging and discharging processes, batteries can emit gases, including hydrogen and carbon monoxide. CO is particularly dangerous as it is colorless and odorless, posing a risk of poisoning to human operators.
2. **High Temperatures:**
   - The chemical reactions within batteries and fuel cells generate significant heat. Without adequate ventilation and cooling, the room can reach high temperatures, making it unsafe for human occupancy and potentially damaging the equipment.

**Safety Protocols:**
- **Pre-Entry Sensor Activation:**
  - Before any human operator enters the battery room, sensors for evaluating CO levels, temperature, and humidity are activated. These sensors are strategically placed at various points within the room to provide accurate and comprehensive readings.
- **Assessment and Response:**
  - If the sensors detect CO levels above permissible exposure limits (typically below 35 ppm for continuous exposure), or temperatures exceeding the safe operational range (which can vary but often is around 25-30°C for battery rooms), an automated system activates fans and cooling units.
  - The ventilation system is designed to rapidly expel hazardous gases and reduce the temperature to acceptable levels, ensuring the environment is safe for human entry.
  
**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Once the operator enters the room, the sensors remain active to continually monitor the conditions. This real-time monitoring ensures that any sudden changes in CO levels or temperature are immediately detected, triggering the ventilation and cooling systems if necessary.

**Maintenance and Inspection Tasks:**
- The operator's tasks might include visual inspections of the batteries or fuel cells, checking for signs of wear or damage, performing diagnostic tests, replacing faulty components, and ensuring all systems are operating efficiently.
- Due to the critical nature of these tasks, it is essential that the room maintains optimal conditions to protect the health of the operator and ensure the proper functioning of the energy storage systems.

**Additional Safety Measures:**
- The room is equipped with alarm systems that alert the operator if conditions become unsafe, providing additional assurance of safety.
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as CO detectors, heat-resistant clothing, and respiratory protection may be required for the operator.
- Regular maintenance of the ventilation and cooling systems is conducted to ensure they are always operational when needed.

### Conclusion
The industrial battery room scenario illustrates a critical environment where proactive and continuous monitoring of hazardous conditions is essential. By employing advanced sensors and automated response systems, the facility ensures the safety of human operators while maintaining the integrity and functionality of crucial energy storage systems. This approach not only protects workers but also helps in preventing potential operational downtimes and equipment failures.
